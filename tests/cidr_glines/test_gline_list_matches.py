"""Tests for gline_list() enumerating every matching G-line, and for the
non-oper restriction on wildcard/text-covering searches.

Historically `GLINE <mask>` (both the oper form and the plain-user form)
only ever returned the first matching G-line. Reported bug: after adding
G-lines on `*@1.2.3.4`, `*@1.2.3.0/24`, and `*hidden@1.2.3.4`, querying
`1.2.3.4` only showed the first one -- never the CIDR parent, never the
second G-line sharing the same exact tree node.

The fix makes gline_list() enumerate every match: for a concrete ip/cidr,
it walks the CIDR tree from the deepest covering node up through every
ancestor (mirroring gline_lookup()'s real per-connection containment
walk), plus checks family-ambiguous ip-mask G-lines that live outside the
tree via a numeric ipmask_check(). Non-opers get the same numeric
treatment for a concrete ip/cidr (no privilege gap there), but are
restricted to exact string matches for anything that doesn't parse as an
ip/cidr -- wildcards are only honored on the user@ part -- so they cannot
enumerate/discover wildcarded G-lines or BadChans by pattern fishing the
way an oper can.
